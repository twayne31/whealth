### Team whealth: Brad, Mitch, Taylor & Summiyah


whealth app is a responsive web one-page application that allows a user to log their daily food intake. The user will search a large database of food choices and select the food option that best matches what they have eaten. Once selected the food item will log into a MySQL database and then post to the page allowing the user to see what foods they have eaten for the day, including quanties and calories. 

**UI/UX:** [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) was used to design and style the funcitonality of the app, including unique/specific styling to select food items and log meals. 

**API:** [Nutritionix](https://www.nutritionix.com/business/api)
