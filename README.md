whealth app is a responsive web one-page application that allows a user to log their daily food intake. The user will search a large database of food choices and select the food option that best matches what they have eaten. Once selected the food item will log into a MySQL database and then post to the page allowing the user to see what foods they have eaten for the day, including quanties and calories. 

**UI/UX:** [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) was used to design and style the funcitonality of the app, including unique/specific styling to select food items and log meals. 

**API:** [Nutritionix](https://www.nutritionix.com/business/api)
 
**Stretch Goals & Vision:** 

1. Have images of food display with the food items that are logged. 
2. Create a Nutrition Label that will give standard FDA nutrition information. 
3. Pricing information of food items from local stores unsing geo-location. Allow us to have users find healthy food options for the lowest prices.
